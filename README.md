# 👋 Welcome! I am Anshul.

🚀 I build things. I break things. All of it—to learn.  
Because **here germinates what blooms beyond**.  
The genius, apparently, has its roots here too.

I'm passionate about **AI, blockchain, software, books, poems, stories, visual arts**, and any kind of art, apparently.
